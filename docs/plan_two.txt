Oct 29th, 2017:
	- Ran into issues: 
		- huge numbers from relu, use linear activation instead since data is standardized
		- we all NEED to understand every line of the code, specifically backpropagation 
		- why do we transpose?
	- Jordan will try his own version in matlab with a small subset

Oct 30th, 2017:
	- Shabab&Brynn, go through each line of the python code with a small subset of the dataset. Use hand calculations and matlab/octave for assistance
	- correct issues with huge numbers (add regularization?, change learning rate?)
	- Meet up with Jordan (8pm) and see where we're at
	Goal: understand each line

Oct 31st, 2017:
	- Jordan, Brynn, Shabab meet up after class, make sure this thing works with 20k rows
	- pretty much just get the kohde right
