Initial:
- build a simple one in python
- forward propagation 
- backpropagation
- no hidden layer
- linear activation

Reminders:
- generic activation function, need a regression or tanh like function, not classification stuff like
sigmoid and whatnot
- put the csv data in a database?
- normalize our data, take the data, find the mean, find the variance, using the variance, get std. dev. normalize all

Legit one:
- multi hidden layers
- better fitting activation function

Schedule:
- oct 16th progress report
- have the prototype working by 16th
- by friday night have a prototype 
- saturday morning we do a touch base,
